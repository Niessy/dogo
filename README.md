dogo
----
DigitalOcean recently open sourced an official Go api ... so you should probably just use that.
[DO Go Official API](https://github.com/digitalocean/godo)

If that one is too heavy, then try this one maintained by Hashicorp. It's very similar to this
one except better maintained and a bit more lightweight. But if all you need is droplets and domains it's solid.

DigitalOcean Go Client API.
