dogo
====
DigitalOcean Go Client V2 API.

Alternatives:
  * [DO Go Official API](https://github.com/digitalocean/godo)
  * [Pearkes DO API](https://github.com/pearkes/digitalocean)

I think this API is a sweetspot between these two. It has more features than Pearkes but more lightweight than the DO Official API.

See the [docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/domluna/dogo).
