digitalocean
============

DigitalOcean Go Client API.

Alternatives
[DO Go Official API](https://github.com/digitalocean/godo)
[Pearkes DO API](https://github.com/pearkes/digitalocean)

I think this API is a sweetspot between these two. It has more features than Pearkes but isn't as strict as the DO Official API.

See the [docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/domluna/digitalocean).
